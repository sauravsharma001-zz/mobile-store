# MobileStore

This is a final project developed for Web Programming Course.

## Project Description

The online mobile store website allows the user to purchase mobile phones. The homepage displays some of the bestselling mobiles, clicking on which we can directly go to the respective phone’s details page. The mobile listing page displays the list of available phones. We can use filters to display only the phones that fits the user’s requirements. We can also use search to list the required phones. A phone can be added to the cart even if the user is not logged in but to proceed to checkout, he/she must log in or register as a new user if he/she has not registered already. In the checkout page, the user can increase the quantity, delete items from the cart and place the order. The user’s order history page displays the orders placed by the user till date.

## Development server

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build. After that run 'nodemon' for starting a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
